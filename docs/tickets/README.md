# Tickets

One file per ticket, kept next to the code it changes and tracked with it — except while it is
embargoed, see [below](#an-open-security-finding-is-embargoed). **A ticket is a work list.** It
holds what has to be done, what was verified and how, and what was deliberately left out — and
when the work lands it is **moved to [archive/](archive/)**. Nothing outside this directory may
reference a ticket; decisions live in [docs/adr/](../adr/) and may be referenced from anywhere.
The rule and the reasoning behind it are
[ADR 0034](../adr/0034-tickets-are-work-lists-that-get-archived.md).

Before archiving a ticket, move anything durable out of it — the decision into an
[ADR](../adr/), the operator-visible consequence into [README.md](../../README.md),
[docs/operations/](../operations/) or [docs/security/](../security/), the contributor-facing
one into [docs/developer/](../developer/) or [DEVELOPER.md](../../DEVELOPER.md) — then
`git grep` its number and its T-label and clear whatever is left. **The extraction is the
close** — archiving is only what happens to the file afterwards, and an archived file is
history, never a source of a current rule.

This page carries the rules only. There is no index table here and no board: the tickets'
own frontmatter is the index ([below](#there-is-no-index-table-and-no-board)).

## Naming and numbering

`NNN-<kebab-slug>.md`, three digits, the slug naming the outcome or the defect. A ticket with a
T-label takes the label's number: T33 is ticket 033, and its frontmatter keeps `id: T33`,
because code and ADRs cite the label. A new ticket takes the next free number — the highest
existing number plus one — and its `id:` is `T` and that number (ticket 043 is `T43`). **A
number is never reused**, including the number of an embargoed ticket and of an item that
never got a file of its own: T1–T29 without a file here are recorded in
[archive/039](archive/039-findings-from-the-1-11-0-fleet-rollout.md).
Moving a ticket into `archive/` changes its directory, not its name.

The highest existing number, archived and embargoed tickets included — the `local_` prefix is
stripped before sorting — printed from the repository root:

```
ls docs/tickets docs/tickets/archive | sed -nE 's/^(local_)?([0-9]{3})-.*/\2/p' | sort -n | tail -1
```

Run it in the owner's working tree: `local_` files are gitignored, so a fresh clone cannot see
an embargoed ticket's number and would hand it out a second time.

Numbering started on 2026-09-27. The files written before it were given numbers as follows,
and they keep them: 037, 038 and 039 are the multi-item analysis records that predate the
one-file-per-ticket rule, and 040, 041 and 042 are the open sibling tickets formerly labelled
C3, C2 and S1; each of those three says so under its title.

## An open security finding is embargoed

A ticket is **embargoed** while its frontmatter says `security: live` or `security: boundary`
and a live or boundary finding in it is not fixed; `state: done` alone does not end it. **The
embargo ends when the finding is fixed, not when the ticket closes**
([ADR 0034](../adr/0034-tickets-are-work-lists-that-get-archived.md) D4): a ticket can reach
`done` with a live or boundary risk accepted rather than fixed. A `dropped` live or boundary
finding is unfixed by definition, so it stays embargoed unless the owner explicitly accepts
publishing it; that acceptance is recorded as the frontmatter field `publication-accepted:` with
its date before the file is renamed. While a ticket is embargoed:

- **Its file carries the `local_` prefix**: `local_NNN-<kebab-slug>.md`. Two ignore rules
  match it: this repository's own [`.gitignore`](../../.gitignore) carries
  `docs/tickets/**/local_*`, so the file stays untracked in every clone, in `docs/tickets/` and
  in `archive/` alike, and the owner's global ignore rule `local_*` (`~/.gitignore`, set as
  `core.excludesFile`) matches it as well. Verified 2026-09-27 with `git check-ignore -v`,
  which names the repository rule for both embargoed files. Neither rule stops `git add -f`.
  *(corrected 2026-09-27: the line was
  `docs/tickets/local_*`, which did not reach `archive/`;
  [ADR 0034](../adr/0034-tickets-are-work-lists-that-get-archived.md) Status.)*
- **No tracked file carries its exploit details** — not its threat line, its mechanism, its
  attack path, and not its file name, whose slug states the finding. For the same reason
  neither does a commit message or a pull request. A tracked file may name the embargoed
  ticket's id, severity, security class, effort and state, and puts in place of the details:
  "embargoed security finding, open - details in its own ticket file until it is fixed".
- **It still takes its number**, so the tracked numbering has gaps where embargoed tickets sit.

When the `shipped:` line of a `done` ticket names the fix of every live or boundary item of the
ticket, the file is renamed without the prefix (`local_NNN-<slug>.md` becomes
`NNN-<slug>.md`) and is tracked from then on like any other ticket; the embargo notes in
tracked files may then be replaced by what they stood for. A ticket that reaches `done` with a
live or boundary item whose risk was accepted rather than fixed (a multi-item ticket included)
keeps the prefix, like a `dropped` one, until the owner explicitly accepts publishing it; that
acceptance is the `publication-accepted:` date. When its `state:` reaches `dropped`,
the file keeps the prefix and stays untracked; it is renamed the same way only after the
owner's explicit acceptance above. A `hardening` finding is not embargoed.

## Nothing outside this directory references a ticket

No file outside `docs/tickets/` — not `README.md`, not a page under `docs/`, not an ADR, not
`CLAUDE.md`, not a code comment — and no commit message or pull request cites a ticket: not its
number, its T-label, its file name or its path. Cite the ADR that holds the rule instead. A
ticket may cite an ADR; an ADR does not cite a ticket.

**Partly implemented.** The rule binds every citation written from 2026-09-27 on. The ticket
citations that already exist outside this directory — T-labels in ADRs, in Go comments, in
`CLAUDE.md` and in the security pages under [docs/security/](../security/README.md) (moved
there verbatim from the former `SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`), the `NA61`–`NA63` labels defined in
[archive/037](archive/037-recovery-after-transient-admission-webhook-rejection.md), and the
links from ADRs into this directory — stay until they are rewritten. They are the work list of
[ticket 040](040-tracked-files-cite-work-items-instead-of-adrs.md), which counts them, and they
are not a precedent.

## There is no index table and no board

The frontmatter `state:` line of each ticket is the index:

```
grep -rH '^state:' --include='[0-9]*.md' --include='local_[0-9]*.md' docs/tickets
```

The `--include` patterns keep this page out of the result, because the frontmatter example
below starts its lines with `state:` as well. The board was retired on 2026-09-27 on Hans's
instruction; its final state is archived verbatim in
[archive/039, "Board archive"](archive/039-findings-from-the-1-11-0-fleet-rollout.md#board-archive--final-state-of-local_boardmd-retired-2026-09-27).

Six files carry no frontmatter. Tickets 040, 041 and 042 state their state in the
`> **Status: …**` blockquote under the title
(`grep -rH -m1 '^> \*\*Status' --include='[0-9]*.md' docs/tickets`); the archived
multi-item records 037, 038 and 039 are closed by being in `archive/`. An embargoed ticket shows
up in the grep only on a machine that holds its file.

## The filing rule

**A finding goes into an existing ticket first.** Before anything new is opened, the finding is
assigned to the open ticket whose subject it shares - the same component, mechanism or kind of
change - and becomes part of that ticket's current state and required changes. A ticket collects
similar findings. Only when no open ticket fits is a new ticket opened (Hans, 2026-09-27;
[ADR 0034](../adr/0034-tickets-are-work-lists-that-get-archived.md) D5). A collecting ticket is
still one subject: findings that share only the event or the analysis that found them are not
collected in one file. A row somewhere, or a finding that lives only in a report, is never
enough.

**An `## Open questions` section is expected wherever a decision is open**: one subsection per
question, understandable on its own, with the sensible options, the recommended one marked and
the mark justified, and an `**Answer:**` line that Hans fills in. Decisions are put to Hans one at
a time (Hans, 2026-09-26, global rule). An adversarial pass is warranted for severity high+ or
security live/boundary.

## Frontmatter

Copy the skeleton below into `NNN-<kebab-slug>.md` (`local_NNN-<kebab-slug>.md` while
[embargoed](#an-open-security-finding-is-embargoed)). Every field is mandatory unless marked
optional.

```yaml
---
id: T27
title: fresh TLS clusters carry no fingerprint
state: filed          # filed -> analysed -> decided -> in-progress -> done | dropped
severity: high        # critical | high | medium | low | cosmetic  (impact if never fixed)
security: live        # live | boundary | hardening | none         (see scale below)
threat: "no attacker; rotated material never reaches fresh clusters"  # required unless security: none
urgency: now          # derived via the rules below, never gut feeling
effort: M             # XS | S | M | L
blocked-by: decision  # optional: decision | human | product | release | adr-NNNN | T<NN>
filed-from: T25       # optional: the analysis or event that produced it
opened: 2026-08-27
decided:              # date, when state reaches decided
done:                 # date, when state reaches done
shipped:              # optional, set with done: one line naming what shipped (for an embargoed ticket: the fix of every live or boundary item)
dropped-reason:       # optional, set with dropped: one line
publication-accepted: # optional, embargoed tickets only: date of the owner's explicit acceptance to publish an unfixed finding
---
```

### Security scale (threat-model based, not high/low)

| Class | Meaning | The `threat:` line must name |
|---|---|---|
| `live` | weakens a guarantee the repo already gives, no hostile principal needed | the guarantee and who relies on it |
| `boundary` | real trust-boundary hole, needs a hostile principal | principal + verb + target (e.g. "a principal who may create `Valkey` CRs names one so that its generated StatefulSet name hits a foreign StatefulSet") |
| `hardening` | defense-in-depth, no concrete attack path today | what it would additionally cover |
| `none` | not security | — |

A blanket statement ("could be a security risk") does not fill the `threat:` field.

### Urgency derivation — apply top-down, first match wins

| Rule | Urgency |
|---|---|
| Defect in an **unreleased feature on the current branch**, or a **measured-false statement in tracked files** | `now` |
| Gates the release, or is gated on it (cluster ops) | `release` |
| severity ≥ medium **and** trigger live | `next` |
| Everything with a decided fix or a cheap known fix | `later` |
| Needs a product call, a human re-decision, or a threat-model escalation nobody has accepted | `icebox` |

Urgency is recomputed when facts change (a dormant trigger goes live, a severity gets
re-measured); the comment of the `urgency:` line names the rule that matched.

## Body skeleton

**A ticket shows the current state and nothing else**
([ADR 0034](../adr/0034-tickets-are-work-lists-that-get-archived.md) D9). There is no History
section. When a fact, a question or an answer changes, the text is rewritten to the new state:
nothing is struck through, nothing is annotated with a date, and no account of how the code or the
ticket evolved is kept - git keeps that for a tracked ticket. Done work items are removed. The
content must be graspable in a few minutes.

```markdown
## Current state

What the code, configuration or documentation does today and why that is a problem, with
file:line links. Impact in a few lines: who hits it and what breaks; if security != none, the
principal, the action and the target. Only the facts the change or a decision needs.

## Required changes

The target state: what changes where (files, functions, docs, ADRs) and the tests that prove it
("merged" is not verification). Split into "Independent of the open questions" and "Depends on
the answers" when both exist.

## Open questions            <- wherever a decision is open

### Q1: <the question in one sentence>

Context in one to three sentences. The sensible options, each with its cost or consequence; the
recommended one marked and justified.

**Answer:** _open_

## Not verified              <- only if something unknown still matters

What is not known, and what would settle it.

## Related                   <- optional

One line per related ticket.
```

## Index maintenance

- State change → the frontmatter `state:` and its date field, in the same commit-of-work.
- `done` → `state: done`, `done:` stamped, and the one-line `shipped:` field. Then the
  extraction above, then the move to [archive/](archive/) — and, for an embargoed ticket, the
  rename without the `local_` prefix only when the `shipped:` line names the fix of every live or
  boundary item; otherwise it keeps the prefix until the owner's explicit, dated publishing
  acceptance (`publication-accepted:`, [above](#an-open-security-finding-is-embargoed)).
- `dropped` → `state: dropped` and the one-line `dropped-reason:` field, then the move to
  [archive/](archive/). An embargoed ticket keeps its `local_` prefix and moves to
  [archive/](archive/) with it; the repository ignore line keeps it untracked there
  ([above](#an-open-security-finding-is-embargoed)).
- Every open item has had its own file since 2026-09-27: T12, T18, T23, T26 and T29 were
  extracted from the collection ticket, now
  [archive/039](archive/039-findings-from-the-1-11-0-fleet-rollout.md), and C3, C2 and S1 became
  tickets 040, 041 and 042.
